    <p class="small">
      <strong>Signal Forge Sports</strong> is an analytics platform built to identify meaningful signals in
      <strong>RAF and other emerging sports markets</strong>—areas where coverage is limited and pricing
      can be less mature.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      We focus on <strong>signal quality</strong>, <strong>confidence thresholds</strong>, and <strong>market context</strong>.
      Just as important, we explicitly avoid generating signals when confidence does not meet our internal standards.
      Restraint is a feature.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">What we believe</h2>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>Not every event has value.</li>
      <li>Discipline matters more than volume.</li>
      <li>Signals should inform decisions, not replace them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">What this is</h2>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>A data-driven signal platform for under-covered sports</li>
      <li>Designed to help users interpret market context responsibly</li>
      <li>Built with clear boundaries and conservative language</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">What this is not</h2>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>Betting advice</li>
      <li>Picks, locks, or guarantees</li>
      <li>A promotional or bonus-driven site</li>
    </ul>
